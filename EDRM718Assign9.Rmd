This is a study of the relationship of income to ethnicity using a sample of
American workers. In this study I want to determine if there is a difference
in the average income of workers of different ethnic backgrounds after 
adjusting for years of education.

```{r include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

inc_data <- read_csv("Ethnic Income Data.csv")

inc_data$Race <- factor(inc_data$Race,
                        levels = c("b", "h", "w"),
                        labels = c("Black", "Hispanic", "White"))

```
